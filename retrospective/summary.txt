// How was the merge conflict resolved?
    in this step my merge conflict was resolved by learning how to read the text editor 
    from here i was able to understand how to make changes to both documents to merge them
    i found the differences beetween the two files and was able to solve the merge conflict


// Name three things you changed in step one
    1.  Added the files into a folder for ease and to clean up the explorer
    2.  Renamed all the files to have a similar marker to keep them easy to access, commit, and push, in unision 
    3.  Changed internal contents to relay desired function of each file        
        for example, file one is primary working file, two is secondary, and third is backup.
